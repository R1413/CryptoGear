Title:
CryptoGear

Description: 
An app that helps users to build up their knowledge about cryptography by way of an encryption/decryption game. A user of this app should be able to play a part in encrypting and decrypting messages so that he/she can enjoy the game, and learn at the same time about cryptography.

Vision statement: 
To create a more security competent society.

Motivation: 
As society is becoming more reliant on technology, security becomes an important topic. Providing the knowledge of how to maintain a safe security status is our motivation for this project. 

Risks: Most of the team members are new to Java, and all are new to working in Android Studio.

Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:
To deal with the risk of learning the new language, our group needs to find many learning resources for Java. In addition, the group needs to watch tutorials on how to create an Android app using Android Studio.

List of requirements: 


| User Requirements   | ID | Agile Points | Priority | Time Estimate to complete|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  As a user, I want to have a very well-responding user interface so that I can enjoy the game. | 01 |  2 | High | ~5 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  2. As a user, I want the app to be well-organized so that it is intuitively easy to navigate.  | 02  | 3 | Medium| ~4 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|



| Functional Requirements   | ID | Agile Points | Priority | Time Estimate to complete|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  3. As a user, I want to be able to undergo a training ground, so that I am able to learn the basics of encryption and decryption. | 03  | 5 | High | ~5 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  4. As a user, I want to be able to score points as I play this game so that I can keep record of my game history and my level of understanding of cryptography.  | 04 | 20 |	Low | ~8 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  5. As a user, I want something that provides the text for me to encrypt so that I can begin a challenge. | 05  | 13 | Low | ~3 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  6. As a user, I want to be able to send and receive encrypted text across different users so that the game can be multi-player. | 06 | 8 | Critical | ~7 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  7. As a user, I want to be able to summon a built-in assistant whenever I need it, so that I can be assisted as I attempt my encryption or decryption. | 07 |52  | Nice-to-have| ~6 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  8. As a user, I want a clean, logical, and intuitive interface for working on my encryption or decryption so that I can work on my encryption or decryption smoothly. | 08 | 33 | Low | ~4 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|



| Non-functional Requirements   |ID | Agile Points | Priority | Time Estimate tocomplete|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  9. As a user, I want my account info to be kept track of as I play the game (name, level, profile info, game history) so that other players and I can see who I am. | 09  |  1 |High |~4 hours|
|---|---|---|---|---|




Each requirement must have a unique ID number
(Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”)

Time estimate to complete
(All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.)

[optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
[optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
[optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)

Methodology: (Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of …)
We will be using the Agile methodology for this team project.
