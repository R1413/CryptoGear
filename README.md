Title:
CryptoGear

Description: 
An app that teaches the user the about cryptography and serves as an encryption and decryption tool

Vision statement: 
To create a more security competent society.

Motivation: 
As society is becoming more reliant on technology, security becomes an importanttopic, and providing the knowledge of how to maintain a safe security status is our motivation for this project. 

Risks: Most of the team members are new to Java, and all are new to working in Android Studio.

Mitigation strategy for dealing with the risk:
To deal with the risk of learning the new language, everyone needs to find different resourses to learn Java, and for Android Studio, everyone needs to watch tutorial videos on how to create an Android app in Studio.
List of requirements: 
User Requirements
1.As a user, I want to have a very  well- responding app so that I can quickly have access to the tool when I need.
2.As a user, I want the calculation of encryption/decryption aspects to be quick. 
Functional Requirements
1.As a developer, I want the app to take in user inputs and depending on the inputs, calculates the correct outputs, whether it is to encrypt texts or decrypt texts, so that the app fulfills its purpose in life. 
2.As a developer, I want the app to be responsive to all possible cases of user inputs and handles them accodingly with reasonable output so that the app is logically sound.
Non-Functional Requirements
2.As a developer, I want to have code that is easy to read so that I can quicklyfind possible errors/bugs that may exist in the code.
1.As a developer, I want the Android app to be organized well enough so that I canfind the purpose behind each part of the program. 

Each requirement must have a unique ID number
(Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”)

Time estimate to complete
(All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.)

[optional] you can add priority (Critical, High, Med, Low, Nice-to-have)
[optional] you can add topic/area (e.g., Login, Profile, DB, etc.)
[optional] you can add user type (e.g., Admin, end user, potential customer,…)

Methodology: (Waterfall, iterfall, Agile, mash-up of …)
